# Visual identity baseline

Recorded from the untouched tree before Stage V0, by three instruments. Every
visual stage diffs against this directory and never regenerates it.

| file | written by | what it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `runs/<seed>.json` | `scripts/visual/baseline.ts --write` | A headless run under the scripted greedy policy: decision log, outcome, every visit, every casualty, the final party. |
| `battles/GYMRUN01.json` | same | The determinism seed's battle protocol, nondeterministic lines stripped. |
| `data-digest.txt` | same | sha256 over every file under `src/data/`. Not `contentHash`, which is its own release. |
| `heights.json` | `scripts/visual/measure.mjs --out` | The two guarded screens at 390x844 on SMOKE24: layout height, scroll height, and the decision point's top and bottom edges. |
| `bundle.json` | `scripts/visual/bundle.mjs --out` | Every file in `dist/`, raw and gzipped. |

`test/visual-baseline.test.ts` replays the runs and the battle under `npm test`
and fails on any byte that differs. Heights are compared by
`scripts/visual/measure.mjs --compare docs/visual/baseline/heights.json` after
`npm run build`, and each stage's done marker records the delta from this file.

## Corrections

- **2026-09-10, V1.** `heights.json` `battle.decisionTop` corrected from 611 to
  612. The V0.0 recording left the pointer where the last click landed, on the
  first move button, whose hover state lifts it by one pixel. The driver now
  parks the pointer before every measurement, and the untouched V0.0 build
  re-measured with the parked pointer reads 612. No layout changed; the ruler
  did. Every other number re-measured identical.
