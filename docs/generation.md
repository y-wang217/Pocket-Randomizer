# Generation

What a seed produces, in what order, and why the order is a contract rather
than an implementation detail.

Stage 2's randomizer has to follow the same rules, which is the reason this
document exists at all.

---

## 1. The decision this document was written to record

**Encounter contents are generated eagerly, at run creation, in the same pass
as the map — not at node entry.**

The build spec allows either. This is the one that was taken, and everything
below follows from it.

Both halves of that sentence matter:

- **The map structure** is generated in one pass at run creation because the
  alternative makes roll order a function of player behaviour. The moment
  Stage 3 adds a reward draw between two nodes, a lazily generated map would
  reshuffle every subsequent draw, and every seed recorded before that change
  would replay as a different run. Nothing about the map is decided while the
  player is playing.
- **The contents** — which species, which level — are generated at the same
  time, for every option, including the ones the player will never take. The
  alternative (drawing contents at node entry) is not *wrong*, but it makes the
  number of draws depend on the path taken, which puts the same problem back one
  level down.

The cost is a few hundred microseconds and some generated data nobody sees. The
benefit is that a seed's map and encounters are fixed for as long as the passes
below stay in the same order.

## 2. The passes

`generateSegment(index, rng, tuning)` runs three passes. They are separate on
purpose, and the boundaries between them are the parts that would be expensive
to change later.

### Pass 1 — shape, from the `map` stream

1. The number of steps, from `tuning.stepsPerSegment`.
2. For each step, in order: how many options (`tuning.nodeChoiceCount`), then
   which node *kinds* they are.
3. The rest-availability fix-up (see §4), which may rewrite a kind.

Kinds are sampled **without replacement** when `tuning.distinctKindsPerStep` is
on, and the option count is capped at the number of kinds available. The map
hides encounter contents, so two wild nodes side by side read as one option
printed twice — that is not a choice, it is a choice-shaped rectangle.

### Pass 2 — contents, from the `randomizer` stream

For each node, in index order (step 0 option 0, step 0 option 1, …, then the
gym): the whole team, member by member. Within a member the order is species,
level, ability, then moves in slot order.

This runs after pass 1 completes, which is what lets the rest fix-up rewrite a
node's kind: at the point the fix-up runs, nothing has yet been drawn for that
node's contents, so changing its kind does not strand a draw.

**The stream changed in Stage 2** — from `map` to `randomizer` — and that is the
change the whole stage rests on. A randomizer adds draws constantly (a fourth
move slot, a tier modifier, a bigger gym team), and every one of them would
otherwise have shifted the *shape* of every map generated after it. The shape is
now fixed by `map` and the contents by `randomizer`, and neither can move the
other. `test/randomizer.test.ts` asserts it directly rather than trusting it to
the construction.

### Pass 3 — sim seeds, from the `battle` stream

One `sodium` PRNG seed per battle node, in the same index order.

This is a separate pass and a separate stream so that changing what a node
*contains* cannot shift the damage rolls of a node earlier in the map.

It also fixes a bug that would otherwise be invisible: `createBattle` derives
its PRNG seed from the run seed, so a run that let every battle do that would
play the *same* damage rolls, crits and accuracy checks in every fight, eight
nodes running. `test/generation.test.ts` asserts every battle in a segment gets
a distinct seed.

### Before all of it — starter options

`generateStarterOptions` draws from the `randomizer` stream **before** the first
segment, so widening the starter pool changes what a recorded seed offers but
does not reshape its map.

The player's Pokemon is randomized like everything else — species, ability and
moveset. A randomizer where the opponents are randomized and the player's
Pokemon is a curated set piece is a game about reacting to chaos rather than a
game about playing it. The one concession is the band window in
`data/starters.ts`, which is also Stage 5's unlock seam.

## 3. Levels

```
player level    = scaling.SEGMENTS[segment].playerLevel
encounter level = player level + draw(scaling.SEGMENTS[segment].levelOffset[kind])
```

Stage 1 computed this as `starterLevel + segmentIndex * levelPerSegment`. It is
an eight-row table now, because a multiplication is a straight line and a
straight line is the one difficulty curve you cannot bend at the segment the
report says is a cliff.

There is no XP and no grinding. The player's level is a pure function of segment
index and moves exactly once per segment, when a gym falls. Encounters chosen
within a segment affect *what you get*, not *how strong you are*.

The offsets that ship were measured, not guessed — see docs/balance.md.

## 4. Guarantees generation makes

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| No rest node before `tuning.restEarliestStep` | A rest on step 0 heals nothing, and a step whose only interesting option is a no-op teaches the player the map does not matter |
| At least `tuning.minRestSteps` steps offer a rest | Weighted draws can produce a segment with nowhere to heal. That is not a hard run, it is a run whose seed decided the outcome |
| No two options in one step share a kind | The map hides contents, so a repeated kind is a duplicate button |
| The gym is never an option | It is not a choice, so it must not reach `chooseNode` — a policy asked to pick from a list of one records a decision the player never made |
| Every node carries a `tier` | Stage 1 writes `normal` and never displays it. Stage 3 keys reward pools to it, and retrofitting a field onto generated data would invalidate every seed recorded before the change |

## 5. What a seed does *not* fix

The seed fixes the map, the encounters and the PRNG for each battle. It does
not fix the run: the player's decisions do the rest. Two players on the same
seed making the same choices get the same run, turn for turn. Two players on the
same seed making different choices get different runs on the same map — which is
the property the whole thing exists for.

Consequently, a **`RunLog` is a seed plus a decision sequence and nothing else**
— no HP, no party, no map, no turn numbers. All of that is derived, and a log
that stores derived state is a log that can disagree with the engine that
produced it. `test/run-replay.test.ts` asserts the serialized log contains none
of those words, and that resuming from a save taken after *every* decision in a
run reproduces the original run exactly.

The log's `version` embeds the engine version, because a decision sequence is
only replayable against the mons, generation and sim it was recorded with.
Stage 0's logs carry a different version and are rejected with a message saying
so, rather than replayed into a plausible run the player never played.

## 6. The tuning, and how it was arrived at

`npm run sim -- --seeds 1000` plays a thousand full runs headless under two
policies and reports the distribution. **docs/balance.md carries the report and
the four findings that moved the numbers**; this section says only where the
numbers live.

| file | holds |
|---|---|
| `data/scaling.ts` | the curve: eight rows of level, band window and team size |
| `data/starters.ts` | what the player begins with, including the move band |
| `data/tuning.ts` | map shape, rest, and recovery between segments |
| `data/blacklists.ts` | the exceptions, each with the evidence that earned it |
| `data/speciesPools.ts`, `data/movePools.ts`, `data/abilities.ts` | generated from the dex by `npm run gen:pools`; the inventory, not the levers |

If a balance pass ever requires editing `core/randomizer.ts`, the split between
logic and data is wrong and that is the bug to fix first.

## 7. Versioning, and the thing that silently breaks a seed

A `RunLog` carries three strings:

- `seed` — the run.
- `version` — the log format and the engine. Moves when a decision sequence
  would replay differently because the *engine* changed.
- `randomizerVersion` — the data and the draw order. Moves when a tuning pass
  changes what a seed *rolls*.

The second one is the interesting addition. A band window widened in
`scaling.ts` leaves every recorded decision sequence perfectly replayable and
quietly reinterprets it as a completely different run — the worst available
outcome for a game whose whole promise is that a shared seed is a shared run.
So it is checked separately, with its own message, and a mismatch throws rather
than replaying.

Bump `RANDOMIZER_VERSION` in `core/randomizer.ts` for: a regenerated pool, a
moved band window, a changed level curve, a new draw inside `rollMoveset`, a
reordered data table. It went to `-2` on the first balance pass, where not one
draw changed position and every seed rolled a different team anyway.
